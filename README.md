# unsupervised-learning-challenge-Myopia-Clusters

## Background
As part of the data science team of a medical research company that’s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. our team has tried—and failed—to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. So, your supervisor has asked you to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning.
We have been provided with raw data, so we processed it to fit the machine learning models. Use several clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Then, you’ll create a visualization to share your findings with your team and other key stakeholders.
